"Registering Pega applications in PegaProcess Fabric HubFor seamless management of work that include assignments from multipleapplications, register your applications in Pega Process Fabric Hub By using a unified worklist in Pega Process Fabric Hub, you save time and provide a consistent user experience"
Before you begin: Prepare to register your applications:•Ensure that the application that you want to register is present on a PegaPlatform system that supports HTTPS and has valid certificates •Ensure that the operator IDs in the system that hosts your applications and in the system that hosts Pega Process Fabric Hub are identical
Theoperator ID is case-sensitive Other operator details can differ  between the systems
"•Ensure that you have an Application :Administrators ,Application :Authors , or your custom access group with administrativeprivileges in the system that hosts your applications Note:  If you use a custom access group other than Application :Administrators  or Application :Authors , add the access group to the AllowedRegistrationAccessGroups  dynamic system setting"
"For more information, see Modification  of thestandard mappings published to Pega Process Fabric Hub  andEditing a dynamic system setting Ensure that the access group is present in your operator record"
"For more information, seeDefining  user contact information and application access ©2023 Pegasystems IncPega Process Fabric Hub 3"
"In Pega Process Fabric Hub, you can use Interwoven Worklist that consolidatesassignments from your numerous registered applications By using Interwoven Worklist, users save time and complete daily assignments without switching context between many applications"
"Register your applications in Pega Process Fabric Hub by completing the followingtasks:•Installing the Pega Process Fabric Hub connector component•To connect your applications to Pega Process Fabric Hub, download and install thePega Process Fabric Hub connector component in your remote application thatyou want to register with Pega Process Fabric Hub •Enabling Constellation applications for registration• Merge seamless work management and an innovative UI framework by enabling Constellation applications for registration with Pega Process Fabric Hub"
