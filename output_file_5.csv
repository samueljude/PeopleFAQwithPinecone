Creating a secure connection with Pega Process FabricHub by configuring  OAuth 2 0 authentication Provide a secure connection between the applications that your Pega Platform system hosts and Pega Process Fabric Hub by creating an OAuth 2
"0 client registration As a result, you receive a secure ID and password so that you can ensure that the communication between your applications and Pega Process Fabric Hub is safe"
"By using the OAuth 2 0 protocol, Pega Process Fabric Hub can communicate securely with your applications over HTTPS"
You define  OAuth 2 0 client registration data instances so that Pega Process Fabric Hub can access Pega Platform REST services
"When you define  the OAuth 2 0 client registration, you receive a client ID and a client secret that you use when you register your application in Pega Process Fabric Hub to create a secure connection"
"Client IDs and client secrets are unique to every operator inyour system After you create the client ID and client secret, you can use these credentials to register multiple applications that your operator can then access as an administrator"
